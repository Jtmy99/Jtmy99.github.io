		<div>
			Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,
			That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
			And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
			And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
			The work of hunters is another thing:
			I have come after them and made repair
			Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
			But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
			To please the yelping dogs.  The gaps I mean,
			No one has seen them made or heard them made,
			But at spring mending-time we find them there.
			I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
			And on a day we meet to walk the line
			And set the wall between us once again.
			We keep the wall between us as we go.
			To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
			And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
			We have to use a spell to make them balance:
			‘Stay where you are until our backs are turned!'
		</div>
		<div>
			We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
			Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
			One on a side.  It comes to little more:
			There where it is we do not need the wall:
			He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
			My apple trees will never get across
			And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
			He only says, ‘Good fences make good neighbors.'
			Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
			If I could put a notion in his head:
			'Why do they make good neighbors?  Isn’t it
			Where there are cows?  But here there are no cows.
			Before I built a wall I’d ask to know
			What I was walling in or walling out,
